Reflection on ways of getting binomial co-efficients.

3 ways of getting binomial co-efficients(Pascal's triangle)

1. Recursive method.
Time complexity- o(n * k)
This method is best suited when we require single value ,for example n=5,k=3 and the answer is 10.

2. Dynamic programming approach- 2D array method. It uses 2D array c[][] to calculate binomial co-efficients.
Time complexity - o(n * k)
Space complexity- o(n * k)
This method is best suited when we want many rows of binomial co-efficients.

3.Dynamic programming approach- 1D method. It is space optimized dynamic approach.
Time complexity - o(n * k)
Space complexity- o(k)
This method is used when we want one row of co-efficient. It calculates iteratively each row by replacing the previous row and then replaces the previous row with the current row.


All three ways have same time complexity. i.e o(n * k)
